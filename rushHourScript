START

The man who is holding the gun is HENRY LAFONTAINE, thirty, shaved 
	head, expensive clothes.
	
	
	The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.


Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it.



War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely 
		nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

	Lee gives it his best shot, trying to mimic Carter's dance move.  But 
	it's more martial arts than dance.

				LEE AND CARTER 
		War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely 
		nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll

This is really fun.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

Both women are looking out into the parking lot. After a beat, Johnson 
	gets up.

				JOHNSON
		I gotta pee.
